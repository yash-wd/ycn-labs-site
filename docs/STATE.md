# YCN Labs — Verified Project State

**Timestamp:** 2026-10-15
**Active Development Repository:** `https://github.com/yash-wd/ycn-labs-site`  
**Active Branch:** `main`  
**Verified Starting HEAD:** `5dbab54fbbba7317efe7b8f5616ae250ce16b0f5`  
**Base GitHub main inspected for this documentation task (14 Oct):** `e56e0d7e3374ece8f26b62ddde9417c30d76b585` (historical task preflight, not a claim about current future HEAD).
**Historical Private Checkpoint:** `11468f4b36b3fdf451cd0bf04e5f2ee2868b45a5` (retained in `yash-wd/ycnlabs`)  
**Initial Public Snapshot Commit:** `2bce139af7865a0458af4b22518d07721c0c3e12`  
**Live HEAD Verification:** Run `git rev-parse HEAD` locally — do not trust static documentation.  
**Upstream Synchronization:** Ensure `git fetch && git status --porcelain` is clean and `HEAD == origin/main`.  
**Local Vault Isolation:** Backups, business records, and proof frames remain strictly local in a private vault outside GitHub.

## 1. Verified Quality Gates & Baseline (RUN-VERIFY-01)
- **Quality Gates:** lint / check-types / test / build all exit 0 from fresh clone simulation without `.env.local`.
- **Automated Tests:** 280/280 vitest tests passing across 18 test files (`vitest run`).
- **Type Checking:** 0 errors (`tsc --noEmit`).
- **Lint:** 0 errors / 0 warnings (`eslint .`).
  - *Finding for later review:* `eslint.config.mjs` contains ignore patterns only without substantive lint rule configuration; coverage limitation noted for later quality review (do not expand now).
- **Production Build:** 18/18 routes generated cleanly (`next build --webpack`).
- **Local Environment:** `.env.local` contains only `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT` (operating in staging/noindex mode; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ENV` absent). Note: database, Redis, and email credentials have not yet been configured locally; O-10 access is an active dependency for staging verification.
- **Owner Identity Gate:** Owner confirmed v2 identity on localhost 12 Oct. (Note: Full-site visual acceptance and production readiness are pending and not claimed).
- **Git Hooks & Signing:** Zero active Git hooks; `core.hooksPath` unset; `commit.gpgsign` unset.

## 2. In-Flight Workstreams & Execution Queue
- **Governing Plan:** `docs/YCN_MASTER_PLAN.md` §14 (Published Launch Execution Roadmap at `df13f17`, 13 Oct 2026).
- **Task Status:** 00, 01, 02, 06 done; 05 folded.
- **Mandate & Vision:** `YCN-MANDATE-01` published (`82de0a2`); `YCN-VISION-01` / `DECISION-051` + task 11a published (`633c05e`).
- **Owner direction (14 Oct):** **FOUNDATION FIRST; NO UI/BACKEND CODING** until Gate E readiness and an explicit Owner go-ahead. Master Plan §14 remains the only launch plan. Tasks 07–09 PAUSED (not cancelled or done).
- **Gate A (Owner, 14 Oct 2026):** **COMPLETE for business policy (DECISION-052).** Owner approved O-01–O-10 policies: Hyderabad location, India-first; websites lead + selective web apps/automation + maintenance; email/WhatsApp Business with two-working-day internal response target; evidence-first portfolio; custom INR quotes, 50/30/20 billing, 30-day bug fixes, client backup commitment; 12-month enquiry retention; existing logo after visual approval; plan-first CLOSE; 30 Nov provisional launch target, 10 h/week review availability; existing stack, ₹5,000/month operating budget. Open items (legal entity type, legal/privacy review, infrastructure admin permissions) remain release prerequisites. YCN-DOWNLOADS-VERIFY-01 PASS (no unique loss; 6 copies unhashed; no full inventory).
- **Gate B2 (Owner, 15 Oct 2026):** **COMPLETE for design-system rules (YCN-GATE-B2-DESIGN-01).** Inserted Owner-approved design rules into `docs/YCN_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: cinematic display scale reserved for homepage Hero and designated chapter headings; standard content scale retained across all other UI; signature perimeter signal at 80 CSS px/s (±5%), fading tail, continuous distance-based phase, one shared rAF ticker, hidden/off-screen pause, reduced-motion static composed frames; four existing placements only (Menu continuous mode pilot first; three CTAs migrate together under Task 07b); max two conspicuous signals animating at once, with header CTA signal paused while Hero CTA is visible. Tasks 07/07b/08/09 still paused until Gate E.
- **Gate C/D (Owner, 15 Oct 2026):** **COMPLETE for documentation/architecture approval only (YCN-ARCH-V1-01).** 11a architecture v1.0 Owner-approved 15 Oct 2026 (YCN-ARCH-V1-01); implementation NOT STARTED; legal clearance NOT GRANTED. HLD/LLD aligns business assumptions, manual operating boundaries (monitored `hello@ycnlabs.com`, privacy forwarding alias, manual WhatsApp Business without API, off-the-shelf GST quotation/invoicing tool in INR) and retention (up to 12 months for inactive pre-sales enquiries, manual only, no automated purge) with DECISION-052. Preserves durable acceptance, atomic deduplication, cookieless analytics, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, children's-data caveat and mandatory Task 12 staging scenarios 4–6.
- **Gate B1 (Owner, 15 Oct 2026):** **COMPLETE for canonical copy and page reviews (DECISION-053/054);** H-03/W-06 and Task 10/12 deltas to Gate E.
- **Gate E (target 21 Oct):** Cross-check business facts, content, design rules, HLD/LLD, law/claims, V1 scope and testable acceptance; name first bounded coding task and obtain explicit Owner approval before resuming.
- **Next foundation milestone:** live-claims hotfix on the historical repo `yash-wd/ycnlabs` (first task, 16 Oct), then Gate E readiness check (21 Oct); provisional planning target 30 November 2026 (DECISION-052 O-09); 10 November is historical; reforecast once at Gate E.
- **Independent P0 work:** Task 03 private vault encrypted external backup requires its own authorization. Task 04 deployment identification COMPLETE — ycnlabs.com served by Vercel project ycnlabs-staging, repo yash-wd/ycnlabs, branch main, root apps/web, production commit 6a017e0 (30 Aug), Node 24.x, retention 30 days, no checks; site-v2 previews Blocked because commit email hello@ycnlabs.com is not a GitHub account; live claims investigation COMPLETE (proof/YCN-DEPLOY-LIVE-CLAIMS-01); live-claims hotfix NOT STARTED.
- **Nav baseline:** 14 Oct read-only evidence reviewed (findings PASS); measurements and frames moved to PRIVATE vault `proof/YCN-NAV-07/`; no Owner recording required; Task 07 coding on hold.
- **Brand continuity `BRAND-LOGO-CARRY-FORWARD`:** Brand repo `yash-wd/ycn-labs-brand-library`, branch `wip/brand-export-05`, last reported checkpoint `ffb7715`; canonical `14_CONTINUITY/RESUME_HERE.md`. Technical work saved as WIP; Owner visual review and remaining exports pending. **Logo NOT COMPLETE; no automatic integration, approval or WIP promotion.** Coordinated CLOSE must be plan-first, with no brand `main` push (local `main` reportedly contains unapproved work), and no unapproved deletion. Historical repo `yash-wd/ycnlabs`: WIP branches `site-v2` (11468f4) and `quarantine/group-d` (420e61a) pushed at close 15 Oct; untracked diagnostic files in `scripts/`, `scratch/`, `public/brand/` await vault intake (16 Oct, copy-only). This reminder does not delay task 03 or 11.
- **Charter & Operating Governance:** Existing AGENTS charter remains controlling. Review-by-risk tier and CLOSE deletion/push exceptions are proposed rulings pending explicit Owner ratification (O-08 / charter decision).

## 3. Mandatory Preflight Check
Before modifying any source code, run `git fetch && git status --porcelain` to verify a clean working tree aligned with `origin/main`.

## Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-10-15 (CLOSE, Owner-authorized)
- **Published today:** fe7ce3e B2 design rules; fd84ff9 architecture v1.0; b5c487d file/evidence rule; c43b702 DECISION-053; cd6413a DECISION-054; c375ed1 three-seat rule; this commit close.
- **Completed:** Gates A, B2, C/D; B1 canonical copy and all page reviews; Task 04 deployment identification and claims investigation; brand repo switched to wip/brand-export-05.
- **Not done:** live-claims hotfix (scope drafted in proof/YCN-DEPLOY-LIVE-CLAIMS-01/hotfix-readiness.md, not reviewed by GPT/Claude, not authorized); H-03/W-06 structural choices; Task 10/12 code; Gate E.
- **Tomorrow, FIRST task:** GPT+Claude review of AGY's hotfix scope → hotfix task on yash-wd/ycnlabs branch hotfix/live-claims-2026-10 (text-only; noreply author identity; preview build first; promote only on Owner word). Decisions already made for the hotfix (not yet implemented): hide Cal.com; retention wording = approved 12-month policy pending counsel; Production retention → Unlimited is the Owner's optional one-click before deploy.
- **Owner pending:** CA consultation; privacy/terms counsel; external vault backup drive (Task 03); browser download location; brand visual review; hello@/privacy@ verification.
- **Deviations 15 Oct (AGY):** transcript reads ×3, continue-after-failure ×2, overwritten scripts ×3, reconstructed diffs ×3, unrequested copy ×1, CLOSE run without Owner word ×1 (commit dropped tonight, diff preserved), reads outside wrapper in Task 04 and close verification; logging rule, three-seat rule and close addendum introduced; Owner-terminal cmp is the push gate.
- **Paused:** 07, 07b, 08, 09 until Gate E. Brand: wip/brand-export-05 intact; nothing to brand main. Historical WIP branches pushed; hotfix branches from origin/main 6a017e0 only.
